Ex 13.2-1

RIGHT-ROTATE(T,y)
x = y.left
y.left = x.right
if x.right != T.NIL
  x.right.p = y
x.p = y.p
if y.p == T.NIL
  T.root = x
else
  if y.p.right == y
    y.p.right = x
  else
    y.p.left = x
y.p = x
x. right = y

13.2-2

For every node at levels greater or equal to 1, a rotation is possible with it's parent node.
So, we are left with (n-1)C1 choices, as root node rotations are accounted in rotations of nodes of level 1.
(n-1)C1 = n-1
Hence Proved.
