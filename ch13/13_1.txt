Solution 13.1-1 
  for bh(root) = 2, level 1 and 3 nodes are all red.
  for bh(root) = 3, level 1 nodes are black or level 3 nodes are black.
  for bh(root) = 4, all nodes are black.

Solution 13.1-2
  No,addenum node if red, it won't be a R-B tree because it will not satisfy property 4.
  No, because if addenum node is black, node with key 38 has undefined black-height. A contradiction to property 5.
  
Solution 13.1-3
  property 1,3,4,5 checked..
  property 2 satisfied, the relaxed R-B tree is R-B tree.
 
Solution 13.1-4
  
 
Solution 13.2-5

Property-5 invariant of a R-B tree states that the black-height of a node is constant. Property-4 and Property-5 combinely states that from a node of RB tree, path to leaves contains constant number of black nodes, equal to the black height of tree and can contain atmost bh(x) + 1 red nodes if the node x is black and atmost bh(x) red nodes if the node x is red.
Hence Proved.

Solution 13.2-6

The root must be black for a RB tree.
to maximize the number of nodes, alternate levels will be red.
so number of nodes is  âˆ‘(1 + 2^1 + 2^2 +....+ 2^(2*k+1))
= 2^(2k+2) - 1
