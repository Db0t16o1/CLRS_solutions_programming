Solution 13.1-1 
  for bh(root) = 2, level 1 and 3 nodes are all red.
  for bh(root) = 3, level 1 nodes are black or level 3 nodes are black.
  for bh(root) = 4, all nodes are black.

Solution 13.1-2
  No,addenum node if red, it won't be a R-B tree because it will not satisfy property 4.
  No, because if addenum node is black, node with key 38 has undefined black-height. A contradiction to property 5.
  
Solution 13.1-3
  property 1,3,4,5 checked..
  property 2 satisfied, the relaxed R-B tree is R-B tree.
 
Solution 13.1-4
